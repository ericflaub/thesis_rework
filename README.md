# thesis_rework

I'd like to redo my thesis research (https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=miami1596020889916973&disposition=inline), but using machine learning techniques I'm currently learning about. The original uses LPM with fixed effects, but I'd like to get ~fancier~.
